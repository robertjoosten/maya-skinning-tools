##Installation
* Extract the content of the .rar file anywhere on disk.
* Drag the skinning-tools.mel file in Maya to permanently install the script.

## Note
The paint tool calls a script that will select all the vertices that are influenced by the parsed influence. You can then paint away the influence on those vertices with the paint tool.
* Undo-able / Redo-able
        
Based on the settings on the skinCluster the following attribute will be respected while removing the influence weights:
* Normalize Weights
* Locked Influences

If you are working with a mesh that contains many influences it is possible to filter then using the search box.
