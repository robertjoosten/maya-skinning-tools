Paint smooth weights tool in Maya using the weights of neighbouring vertices.

Installation
============
* Extract the content of the .rar file anywhere on disk.
* Drag the skinning-tools.mel file in Maya to permanently install the script.

Note
====
The paint tool calls a script that find the surrounding vertices and its
skin weights. These skin weights are then blended with the skin weights
of the original vertex based value of the paint tool.
    * Undo-able / Redo-able

Based on the settings on the skinCluster the following attribute will be
respected while smoothing the weights:
    * Max Influences
    * Normalize Weights
    * Locked Influences

I would like to note that the idea for this script came from
`Tom Ferstl <https://vimeo.com/tomferstl>` he developed a script where
the end results is very simular. I did use the original script as an
inspiration, but what happens under the hood is completely different.
