Installation
============
* Extract the content of the .rar file anywhere on disk.
* Drag the skinning-tools.mel file in Maya to permanently install the script.

Note
====
Delinear weights applies an easing algorithm to the skin weights. This tool
is best used if skin weights have been copied from a low polygon source, when
this is done sometimes it is very obvious that the weights are linearly
divided between the vertices of the low polygon source. This tool will tween
those weights.
